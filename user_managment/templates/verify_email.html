  <h3>Verify Email</h3>
  <p>
    An email has been sent to the email you gave us to activate the account. In order to activate
    the account you must click the link in the email sent to you. Then you will be able to setup
    your profile and start using the website.
  </p>
  <p>Email address email sent to: {{ users_email }}</p>

  <p>
    If the email you have used is invalid then you need to make a new account. Don't worry,
    all the data you entered for the invalid account will be deleted between 24 and 48 hours after it was
    created. Please also note that you will have to wait till the end of this cooldown period
    if you want to create an account with the same username and password combination, as these have to be
    unique to every account.
